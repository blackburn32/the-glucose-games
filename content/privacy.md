## Questions

If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [support@glucose.games](mailto:support@glucose.games).

## Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.

### Information You Provide to Us

We collect the following information from you when you provide it to us:

- **Account Information**: When you sign up for an account to use our Services, we require your email address always, and your username if you use Google to login.
- **Configuration Data**: If you choose to configure your account, such as by setting custom high and low thresholds, we will collect that data as well.

### Information We Collect Automatically

We also collect information automatically as you use the Services:

- **Log Information**: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to your account.
- **Usage Information**: We collect information about the Services you use and how you use them, like how frequently you log in and how long you stay logged in.

### Information We Collect from Other Sources

We may also get information about you from other sources. For example:

- **Third-Party Login**: If you use a third-party service (such as Google) to create an account or sign in we will receive associated login information like your email, username, and connection token.
- **Dexcom Data**: If you connect your account to Dexcom, we will collect estimated glucose values and other data from the Dexcom API. We will also store a credential to access the Dexcom API on your behalf.
- **Nightscout Data**: If you connect your account to a Nightscout instance, we will collect estimated glucose values and other data from the Nightscout API. We will also store a base URL and token to access the Nightscout API on your behalf.

## How and Why We Use Information

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:

- **To provide our Services**: We use information about you to provide the Services to you, like to authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, to visualize your data, and to operate and maintain the Services.
- **To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services**: For example, by monitoring how users interact with our Services, we can identify areas of improvement and provide a better experience for all users.
- **To fix problems with our Services**: For example, by monitoring, debugging, and fixing errors or preventing issues.
- **To protect our Services, and our users**: For example, by detecting security incidents; complying with legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of The Glucose Games and others.
- **To communicate with you about the Services**: We use your contact information to send communications via email in response to your inquiries, to send you service-related announcements, and to send you other communications, including marketing emails.
- **To market our Services and measure, guage, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing**: We use information about you to send you marketing communications, to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, and to understand how you interact with our marketing.


## Sharing Information

We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below:

- **Third-Party Vendors**: We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you like Supabase and Cloudflare; and those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services).
- **Legal Requests**: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
- **Business Transfers**: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that The Glucose Games goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
- **Aggregated or de-identified information**: We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.

## How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it.

For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to The Glucose Games website, like the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 7 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic and investigate issues if something goes wrong on our website.

We keep account information until you delete your account, at which point we will delete all information associated with your account including your custom configurations, estimated glucose values, and login information.

## Security 

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Your Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

- **Limit the Information that You Provide**: If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide optional account information like high and low thresholds.
- **Opt out of marketing communications**: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.
- **Close your account**: If you no longer wish to use our Services, you can close your account. When you delete your account your account configurations and estimated glucose values will be deleted immediately. Please keep in mind, however, that we may continue to retain some other types of information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, log information will be retained for 7 days. 

## Your Rights

If you are located in certain parts of the world, including some US states and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.

### European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.

### US Privacy Laws

Laws in some US states require us to provide residents with additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. You’ll find that information in this section (if you are a California resident, please note that this is the Notice at Collection we are required to provide you under California law).

In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information, depending on the Services used:

- Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
- Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator of a site);
- Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
- Estimated glucose values and other data from the Dexcom API.

We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the [Sharing Information](#sharing-information) section above. We retain this information for the length of time described in the [How Long We Keep Information](#how-long-we-keep-information) section above.

In some US states you have additional rights subject to any exemptions provided by your state’s respective law, including the right to:

- Request a copy of the specific pieces of information we collect about you and, if you’re in California, to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, and the categories of third parties we share it with;
