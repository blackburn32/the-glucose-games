This project represents a blood glucose management website which helps users keep track of their blood glucose control and identify problematic patterns that they can correct to improve their control.

Code structure:
- Frontend code lives in /layouts, /components, /pages, /plugins and /composables
- Server side endpoints live in /server/api, and server specific utilities live in /server/utils
- Code that can run in the frontend and server side lives in /utils
- Type definitions and constants live in /types
- User facing longform text content lives in /content

General conventions:
- Perform all sensitive operations server side, including: Updating the database, accessing blood glucose data
- Take advantage of VueUse functions to enhance reactivity and performance.
- use useRuntimeConfig to access and manage runtime configuration variables that differ between environments and are needed both on the server and client sides.

Project configuration:
- Project dependencies are tracked in [package.json](mdc:package.json)
- Nuxt configuration is found in [nuxt.config.ts](mdc:nuxt.config.ts)
