Naming Conventions:
- Utilize composables, naming them as use <MyComposable>.
- Use **PascalCase** for component file names (e.g., components/MyComponent.vue).
- Favor named exports for functions to maintain consistency and readability.
- Use **lowerCamelCase** for new pages file names, typescript files, typescript functions

- Use **SNAKE_CASE** for constants
