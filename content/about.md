# About The Glucose Games

The Glucose Games are a series of games and contests meant to help people with diabetes optimize their control of blood glucose levels.
These are the first games of their kind, using your blood glucose to control the experiences.
Compete with yourself to improve your control over time, or (in the future) compete with others to see how you stack up against the community.

## How it works

The first step is getting your blood glucose levels hooked up to the games. 
In order to play the game you will need to have a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and you will need to be connected to a [Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io/) instance.
The games will pull your blood glucose data from the Nightscout API.
You can learn more about connecting to Nightscout [here](/aboutNightscout).

## The games

Compete across a broad array of games and contests, including:

- **Longest Streaks**: Keep track of the longest time you've kept your blood glucose in range without lows, highs, or both. Try to beat your records!
- **Daily Streaks**: Keep your blood glucose in range during the specified time for as many days in a row as you can.

Check out a demo of the games [here](/demo).

## Track your progress

As you compete in the games, you'll be able to track your progress over time.
See how your control has improved, and where you might need to focus more attention.
You can see a demo of the progress tracking in action [here](/historyDemo).

## Earn achievements

As you play the games, you'll earn achievements for reaching milestones and completing challenges. 
Keep track of your achievements and see how many you can earn! 
Check out a demo of the available achievements [here](/achievementsDemo). 

## The community (Coming Soon)

While all the games can be played solo, you can also compete against others anonymously in ranked contests.
See how the power of competition can help you improve your control over time!
Use your avatar to represent yourself, and unlock new avatars and looks as you compete in more games and reach new milestones.
